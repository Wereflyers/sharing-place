# sharing-place :left_right_arrow:

Sharing place is an opportunity to tell everybody what things people are willing to share, to find the thing you need, and to rent it for a while. 
The service not only allows you to reserve an item for certain dates, but also closes access to it for the duration of the reservation from other people wishing to do so. In case the necessary thing is absent at the service users have the opportunity to leave requests. New items can be added for shering on request.
